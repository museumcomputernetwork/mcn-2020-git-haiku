Spring is passing.
The birds cry, and the fishes’ eyes are 
With tears.

The summer grasses.
All that remains
Of warriors’ dreams.

A owner of the old thatched hut
Is also changed to another
It’s the Doll’s Festival.

Oh, tranquility!
Penetrating the very rock,
A cicada’s voice.

The rains of summer join together.
How swift it is
Mogami River.

When you say something,
The lips feel cold.
The Autumn wind.

None is travelling
Here along this way but I,
This autumn evening.

The first day of the year:
thoughts come - and there is loneliness;
The autumn dusk is here.

An old pond
A frog jumps in -
Splash!

Old dark sleepy pool
quick unexpected frog
Goes plop! Watersplash!

Lightning -
Heron's cry
Stabs the darkness

Clouds come from time to time -
and bring to men a chance to rest
from looking at the moon.

In the cicada's cry
There's no sign that can foretell
How soon it must die.

Poverty's child -
he starts to grind the rice,
and gazes at the moon.

Won't you come and see
loneliness? Just one leaf
From the kiri tree.

Temple bells die out.
The fragrant blossoms remain.
A perfect evening!

Ballet in the air
twin butterflies until, twice white
They meet, they mate

Black cloudbank broken
scatters in the night; Now see
Moon-lighted mountains!

Seek on high bare trails
sky-reflecting violets
Mountain-top jewels

For a lovely bowl
let us arrange these flowers
Since there is no rice

Now that eyes of hawks
in dusky night
are darkened

Chirping of the quails
April's air stirs in willow-leaves
A butterfly floats and balances

In the sea-surf edge
mingling with bright small shells
Bush-clover petals

The river gathering may rains
from cold streamlets for the sea
Murmuring Mogami

White cloud of mist
above white
Cherry-blossoms

Dawn-shining mountains
Twilight whippoorwill, whistle on, sweet deepener
Of dark loneliness

Mountain-rose petals
falling, falling, falling now
Waterfall music

Ah me! I am one
who spends his little breakfast
Morning-glory gazing

Seas are wild tonight
stretching over Sado Island
Silent clouds of stars

Why so scrawny, cat?
starving for fat fish or mice
Or backyard love?

Dewdrop, let me cleanse
in your brief sweet waters
These dark hands of life

Glorious the moon
therefore our thanks dark clouds
Come to rest our necks

Under cherry-trees
soup, the salad, fish and all
Seasoned with petals

Too curious flower
watching us pass, met death
Our hungry donkey

Cloud of cherry-bloom
tolling twilight bell; Temple
Ueno? Asakura?

Must springtime fade?
then cry all birds and fishes
Cold pale eyes pour tears

Such utter silence!
even the crickets' singing
Muffled by hot rocks

Swallow in the dusk
spare my little buzzing friends
Among the flowers

Bright red pepper-pod
it needs but shiny wings and look
Darting dragon-fly!

Wake! The sky is light!
let us to the road again
Companion butterfly!

Silent the old town
the scent of flowers floating
And evening bell

Camellia-petal
fell in silent dawn, spilling
A water-jewel

In the twilight rain
these brilliant-hued hibiscus
A lovely sunset

Lady butterfly
perfumes her wings by floating
Over the orchid

Now the swinging bridge
is quieted with creepers
Like our tendrilled life

The sea darkening
oh voices of the wild ducks
Crying, whirling, white

Nine times arising
to see the moon, whose solemn pace
Marks only midnight yet

Here, where a thousand
captains swore grand conquest
Tall grass their monument

Now in sad autumn
as I take my darkening path
A solitary bird

Will we meet again
here at your flowering grave
Two white butterflies?

Dry cheerful cricket
chirping, keeps the autumn gay
Contemptuous of frost

First white snow of fall
just enough to bend the leaves
Of faded daffodils

Carven gods long gone
dead leaves alone foregather
On the temple porch

Cold first winter rain
poor monkey, you too could use
A little woven cape

No oil to read by
I am off to bed - but ah!
My moonlit pillow

This snowy morning
that black crow I hate so much
But he's beautiful!

If there were fragrance
these heavy snow-flakes settling
Lilies on the rocks

See: surviving suns
visit the ancestral grave
Bearded, with bent canes
